# Car-Dheko---Used-Car-Price-Prediction
## Domain:
* Automotive Industry , Data Science, Machine Learning
## Introduction:
* In this project, the task is to enhancing the customer experience and 
optimizing the pricing process for used cars by developing a machine learning 
model. This model, based on historical car price data, will take into account 
various features such as the car's make, model, year, fuel type, and transmission 
type. The goal is to predict the prices of used cars accurately and integrate this 
model into an interactive web application using Streamlit.
## Skills take away From This Project:
* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Machine Learning Model Development
* Price Prediction Techniques
* Model Evaluation and Optimization
* Model Deployment
* Streamlit Application Development
* Documentation and Reporting
## Results:  
### XGBOOST regressor:
*Achieved the best performance with the highest RÂ² and the lowest MSE/MAE, making it the chosen model for deployment.
Optuna is used to tune the hyperparameters of the XGBoost model:
Hyperparameters such as n_estimators, max_depth, learning_rate, subsample, and others are tuned.
The model's performance was improved with hyperparameter tuning using Optuna.
Regularization techniques (Ridge and Lasso) were applied to improve model generalization.
The best hyperparameters are identified using cross-validation and stored in best_params.
Final Model: The best model is trained using the tuned hyperparameters and evaluated on the test set.
##  Streamlit Application Development:
 * Deploying the predictive model through the Streamlit application 
revolutionizes the user experience at CarDekho by delivering swift and 
reliable price estimates for used cars.
